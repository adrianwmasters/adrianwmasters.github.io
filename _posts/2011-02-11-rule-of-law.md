# Julian Assange & the Rule of Law

Now all the hype has subsided, it is time for considered debate about what wikileaks has taught us about democracy, government and human nature. Whether Julian Assange is guilty of crimes in Sweden remains to be determined, and should be considered separately from the release of leaked information and response to that leaking.

----

Firstly, the major differences between the publication of Wikileaks and a newspaper article based on leaked information are of volume and transformation. The volume of materials published by Wikileaks is vast compared to that through a series of newspaper articles (or equivalent televisual journalism). Wikileaks material is less transformed from original source material than normal articles.

The differences do not preclude the primary principle behind investigative reporting. That is, when a source provides verifiable information, in the public interest, and it is not libellous, you may publish it. The information may be contravening a law or their contractual obligations, but the publisher may not be breaking any law. In the course of a publisher denying prosecutors the identity of the source, the publisher may be found in contempt of court, but that is different to a charge of breaking commercial confidentiality or of breaking an official secrets act. Was any US paper convicted in the Pentagon Papers case? Were they even charged? Even the perpertrators who leaked the papers were not convicted, the sequence of events leading to Watergate and the resignation of the US President. The conscience of ??Dan Elleberg?? ended in the exposure of major lies about Vietnam, and the exposure in the use of raw power to try to suppress the information leaks.

The knee-jerk reaction of the Australian Prime Minister and the Australian Governor General, asserting that Julian Assange was a criminal for publishing leaked information forms a dangerous precedent. In a Westminster democracy, the executive arm of government does not determine the guilt or otherwise of an individual. It is up to the judicial arm of government to decide that through the rule of law. The parliament may frame laws, which provide the basis for judicial decisions, one of which may be that the law is unconstitutional.

Unfortunately, Australia does not have a bill of human rights which protects freedom of speech. It does have libel and slander laws. I wonder if the assertions of Julian Assange's criminal status are libel or slander. The US constitution and amendments do provide for freedom of speech. I would be interested in how far over the line the calls for Julian Assange's death are regarding incitement to violence and accessory to murder (if he was killed), and how defensible they would be in US courts under freedom of speech amendments.

However, regardless of legal support for freedom of speech, there is a compact between Australian citizens and the government for the government to provide assistance to Australian citizens overseas, particularly under threat of the death penalty or wrongful imprisonment. This usually takes the form of diplomatic pressure on the overseas government. The Australian governments words and actions until recently seemed to have broken that compact. Which side would they back if it was an Indonesian, rather than US, assertion of terrorism against an Australian national (with no legal prosecution)? [While drafting this article, it turns out that there is some consular assistance around his extradition case.]

Another pillar of the rule of law is the concept of jurisdiction. If a US law was broken by Julian Assange, he should be charged if the offence occurred on US territory. If the source provided information to Wikileaks on foreign soil, the material was stored & transmitted exclusively on foreign soil, and the publication of material occurred on foreign soil - the US courts have no jurisdiction over Wikileaks. What would happen if national legal boundaries could be extended globally? Should the imbibing of alcohol by an Australian citizen on Australian soil be subject to Islamic prohibition laws from another country?

A key concept in legal systems descending from British jurisprudence is the presumption on innocence until proven guilty. A number of US & Australian politicians (who should know better) have asserted his guilt without evidence. Without a cursory "alleged" passing their lips, even. There have been calls for hit squads, the death penalty and other excessive measure of "justice". Politicians must realise that their public statements set the tone of discussion, and the reach of their words is broad. There may be no direct line between the US right's rhetoric and the recent shooting, but I argue that inciting hate and violent analogies are easily taken "the wrong way" by individuals. It only takes 1 person and a semi-automatic weapon to kill a number of people. Even if the individual is disturbed, wouldn't you feel just a little bit guilty if that person took your venomous rhetoric as a literal call to arms, killing and maiming?

I am ashamed that signatories to the UN Charter of Human Rights can violate that charter by detention without charge. No wonder that Julian Assange is fighting extradition & fearing that the Swedish case may end up in his transfer to the US.  Australians David Hicks & Mandou??? Habib were unlawfully held without charges or trial by a foreign government (they were not charged as prisoners of war). A precedent has been established.

It is for governments to present a prosecution case for events in their jurisdiction, and the courts to decide under the rule of law if Julian Assange is guilty of those crimes.

It is time for the leaders of the alleged free world to stand behind the democratic ideal, and wholehearted back the rule of law. Otherwise all they support is anarchy and rule of force.
